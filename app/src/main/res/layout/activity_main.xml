            android:text="James Arthur Gosling, OC (born May 19, 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.[3] Contents 	•	1 Education and career 	•	2 Contributions 	•	3 Honors 	•	4 Books 	•	5 See also 	•	6 References 	•	7 External links  Education and career James Gosling received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary [4] and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University.[2][5][6] He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs (Gosmacs) while working toward his doctorate. He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system[7] while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems. He also developed several compilers and mail systems there. Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010 after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation,[8] citing reductions in pay, status, and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges.[9] He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that &quot;during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer's eyes sparkle.&quot;[10] He clarified his position during the Oracle v Google trial over Android: &quot;While I have differences with Oracle, in this case, they are on the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan Schwartz; he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks on Sun.&quot;[11] However, he approved of the court's ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable.[12] In March 2011, Gosling left Oracle to work at Google.[13] Six months later, he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called Liquid Robotics.[1] In late 2016, Liquid Robotics was aquired by Boeing.[14] Following the aquisition, Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May 2017.[15] He is an adviser at the Scala company Typesafe Inc.,[16] Independent Director at Jelastic,[17] and Strategic Advisor for Eucalyptus[18], and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions.[19] He is known for his love of proving &quot;the unknown&quot; and has noted that his favorite irrational number is √2. He has a framed picture of the first 1,000 digits of √2 in his office.[20] Contributions Gosling initially became known as the author of Gosling Emacs, and also invented the windowing system NeWS, which lost out to X Window because Sun did not give it an open source license. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.[21][22][23] He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine.[24] Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate-student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.[25] For his achievement, the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member.[26] Another contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the &quot;bundle&quot; program, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment. Honors 	•	2002: he was awarded The Economist Innovation Award.[27] 	•	2002: he was awarded The Flame Award USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award.[28] 	•	2007: he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.[29] The Order is Canada's second highest civilian honor. Officers are the second highest grade within the Order. 	•	2013: he became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.[30] 	•	2015: awarded IEEE John von Neumann Medal[31] Books 	•	Ken Arnold, James Gosling, David Holmes, The Java Programming Language, Fourth Edition, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2005, ISBN 0-321-34980-6 	•	James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy L.
